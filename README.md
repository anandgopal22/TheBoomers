## Project Description

We have a movie database (movieDB) where we can identify the popularity and ratings of movies and tv shows. We aim to compare these popularity metrics with google costume search trends which we believe might be another kind of popularity indicator amongst the common people.
Data Description
In this project, MovieDB dataset will be used, in which the movies and T.V. shows have been aligned according to the popularity index with a rating from 1 to 5, with 1 being the most famous, and 5 being the least famous, for all 50 states in the US. The dataset for halloween searches has been released by google (google-trends) and is publicly available.

The datasets are available at:-

1. MovieDB - https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US
2. Halloween Searches - https://frightgeist.withgoogle.com/costumes
3. Google Trends -

Rights to use data
Upon investigation, it has been concluded that the data can be used without any specific authorization from any kind of particular sources, or user-specific directories/repositories, since it's a free tool, and open-source data.

## Problem statements:

Main Question to investigate:
To compare the parametrized metrics between the ratings of the critiques and the real popularity of the shows and the movies.

Secondary questions:
1. Trends and outliers in Halloween searches across all the states.
2. Visualise and compare generic costume searches vs movie-specific searches.
3. Do spooky movies/tv-shows trend more near halloween?
